# Contributing to JSON-HD

## How we work
- Specs evolve via RFCs in `/rfcs`.
- Small PRs are preferred (one change per PR).

## Proposing changes
1. Open an issue describing the goal.
2. Add an RFC (copy an existing one and increment the number).
3. Include at least one sample/test vector update when relevant.

## Acceptance criteria
A change is considered ready when:
- it updates the spec or schema (as appropriate),
- it includes an example or sample that demonstrates it,
- CI passes.
